üéØ ELI5: People used to search like robots ("yogurt cake recipe"), 
now they search like humans ("what is the recipe for yogurt cake?"). 
AI has to be smart enough to understand full questions, images, 
even ideas ‚Äî and give a straight answer.

üîÑ KEY SHIFTS IN SEARCH & UX:

1. **From keywords ‚Üí full questions**
   - Old: "yogurt cake recipe"
   - New: "What's a good recipe for yogurt cake that's not too sweet?"

2. **From static filters ‚Üí interactive, natural filters**
   - Old: Checkboxes for "vegetarian", "gluten-free"
   - New: "I'm vegetarian and allergic to nuts, what can I cook?"

3. **From static results ‚Üí conversational guidance**
   - Old: List of links
   - New: AI works like a guide, not just a librarian

‚ùå WHY ELASTICSEARCH ALONE WON'T CUT IT:

It's like trying to find a movie by shouting a whole plot at a DVD store 
clerk who only listens for exact words.

3. **Need for retrieval + reasoning**

üü¢ MODERN STACK SOLUTIONS:

1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
   - Pull facts + let LLM reason
   - Like looking in the right book before answering the question

2. **Add Evaluation (RAG-Triad)**
   - Groundedness: Is the answer based on retrieved facts?
   - Context Relevance: Are the retrieved facts relevant?
   - Answer Relevance: Does the answer address the question?

3. **Add Tools + Planning**
   - APIs, DB queries, external services
   - Multi-step reasoning and execution
   - Fallback and error handling

‚úÖ WHAT WE COVERED:

1. **Macro View**: Why search evolution matters now
   - From keywords to full questions
   - From static filters to natural language
   - From results to conversational guidance

2. **Search Evolution**: Keywords ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Reasoning
   - Ranking ‚â† solving
   - Semantic understanding > exact match
   - Need for retrieval + reasoning

3. **Modern AI Patterns**: RAG + Evaluation + Tools
   - RAG: Pull facts + let LLM reason
   - RAG-Triad: Groundedness, context relevance, answer relevance
   - Tools: APIs, DB queries, planning

üéØ KEY INSIGHTS:

- **Users expect answers, not links**
- **AI needs to work like a guide, not a librarian**
- **Multi-step reasoning is essential**
