## üöÄ Getting Started

### 0. Quick Start with Master Notebook

**Want to run everything in one go?**
```bash
# Open the complete workshop notebook
workshop_master.ipynb
```

This single notebook contains all three parts and can be run sequentially!

### 1. Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**For macOS/Linux users experiencing "externally-managed-environment" error:**

```bash
# Run the setup script (handles everything automatically)
python3 workshop_setup.py

# Or manually:
python3 -m venv llm_workshop_env
source llm_workshop_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For Windows users:**
```bash
python -m venv llm_workshop_env
llm_workshop_env\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

**Option 2: Python Script**
```bash
python workshop_part1_setup.py
```

### Key Concepts
- API endpoints and authentication

- Model parameters (temperature, max_tokens)

---

## ü§ñ Part 2: LLM Agents (45 min)

**File:** `workshop_part2_agents.py`

### What You'll Do
- Create custom tools (calculator, weather, time)
- Build a tool-calling agent with LangChain
- Create a conversational agent with memory
- See how agents reason through complex tasks

### Run It

**Option 1: Jupiter Notebook (Recommended)**
```bash
# Open in VS Code, Cursor, or Jupyter Lab
workshop_part2_agents.ipynb
```

**Option 2: Python Script**
```bash
python workshop_part2_agents.py
```

### Key Concepts
- Tools: Functions agents can call
- Agents: LLMs that can use tools
- Memory: How agents remember conversations
- Reasoning: How agents break down complex tasks

---

## üîå Part 3: MCP Server (45 min)

**File:** `workshop_part3_mcp_server.py`

### What You'll Do
- Learn what MCP is and why it's useful
- Create a simple MCP server with 3 tools
- Understand how to connect from VS Code/Cursor
- Explore advanced MCP capabilities

### Run It

**Option 1: Jupiter Notebook (Recommended)**
```bash
# Open in VS Code, Cursor, or Jupyter Lab
workshop_part3_mcp_server.ipynb
```

**Option 2: Python Script**
```bash
python workshop_part3_mcp_server.py
```

### Generated Files
- `workshop_mcp_server.py` - Your working MCP server

### Key Concepts
- MCP Server: Provides tools and resources
- MCP Client: Connects to servers (VS Code, etc.)
- Tools: Functions the AI can call
- Resources: Data the AI can access

---

## üîå Connecting Your MCP Server to VS Code/Cursor

### 1. Install MCP Extension
- **VS Code**: Search for "MCP" in extensions
- **Cursor**: Should have MCP support built-in

### 2. Configure MCP Client
Create `~/.config/mcp/clients.json`:

```json
{
  "workshop-server": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["/path/to/your/workshop_mcp_server.py"],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Your Editor
The MCP server should now be available!

### 4. Test the Connection
Ask: "What time is it?" or "Calculate 15 * 3"
The AI should use your MCP server tools!

## üéØ Hands-On Exercises

### Part 1 Exercises
1. **Custom Prompts**: Create your own prompts
2. **Temperature Experiment**: Try different temperature values
3. **Token Limits**: Experiment with max_tokens
4. **Model Comparison**: Compare different models

### Part 2 Exercises
1. **Tool Testing**: Ask the agent to use different tools
2. **Multi-Step Tasks**: Give complex requests
3. **Conversation Flow**: Have natural conversations
4. **Custom Tools**: Create your own tools

### Part 3 Exercises
1. **Run Your Server**: Start and test your MCP server
2. **Add New Tools**: Create additional tools
3. **Connect to Editor**: Set up VS Code/Cursor connection
4. **Debug and Improve**: Add error handling

---

## üöÄ Advanced Features

Once you're comfortable with basics, explore:

- **Resources**: Provide access to files, databases, APIs
- **Prompts**: Create reusable prompt templates
- **Logging**: Add structured logging to your server
- **Authentication**: Secure your server with proper auth
- **Streaming**: Handle long-running operations

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Externally-Managed-Environment Error**: 
   - Use the virtual environment setup: `python3 workshop_setup.py`
   - Or manually create a virtual environment (see Getting Started section)

2. **Import Errors**: Make sure all packages are installed in your virtual environment
3. **API Connection**: Verify your endpoint and API key
4. **MCP Connection**: Check your client configuration
5. **Tool Errors**: Ensure your tools handle errors gracefully

### Pydantic Type Annotation Errors

If you see errors like:
```
PydanticUserError: Field 'name' defined on a base class was overridden by a non-annotated attribute
```

**Solution**: The workshop files have been updated with proper type annotations. Make sure you're using the latest versions.

### API 404 Errors

If you see:
```
Error: Error code: 404 - {'error': {'message': 'No route for POST /prod/chat/completions'}}
```

**This is normal!** The custom tools work independently of the LLM API. The 404 errors occur when the agent tries to use the LLM for reasoning, but your tools (calculator, weather, time) work perfectly.

**Test your tools independently:**
```bash
python demo_tools_simple.py
```

### Getting Help

- Check the error messages carefully
- Verify your API configuration
- Test each component individually
- Use the hands-on exercises to debug
